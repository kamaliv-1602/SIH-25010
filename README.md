## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
*Mobile + SMS/IVR platform for farmers with multilingual support.
*AI/ML-based crop recommendation engine using soil, weather, and market data.
*Advisory on fertilizer, irrigation, and pest management (image-based detection + tips).
*Real-time market linkage & price alerts to boost income.
*Integration with government schemes & insurance for financial security.
*Low-cost, scalable, offline-friendly system designed for small and marginal farmers.
## Technical Approach
*Architecture: Mobile App + Web Dashboard (frontend), Cloud-based backend with APIs, secure databases.
*Data Sources: IoT sensors/manual input (soil), weather APIs, market APIs, government datasets.
*AI/ML Models:
Crop recommendation (Decision Tree/Random Forest).
Pest/disease detection (CNN on crop images).
Yield prediction (Regression models).
*Advisory Engine: Rule-based + ML-driven, multilingual NLP + voice/IVR support.
*Communication: App notifications, SMS/USSD, WhatsApp/Telegram bots.
*Scalability: Microservices, offline sync, lightweight UI for low bandwidth.

## Feasibility and Viability
1.Feasibility
*Technical: Uses existing tech (IoT sensors, mobile apps, AI/ML models, APIs). Lightweight apps ensure low internet dependency.
*Economic: Low-cost deployment with scalable cloud services; affordable for farmers via government/NGO support.
*Operational: Easy-to-use (voice, SMS, multilingual), fits into current farming practices.
2.Viability
*Farmer Impact: Increases yield, reduces crop loss, improves income.
*Scalability: Can expand from one region to nationwide with modular design.
*Sustainability: Supports organic methods, efficient resource use, and aligns with government digital agriculture initiatives.
## Impact and Benefits
1.Impact
Empowers small and marginal farmers with data-driven decisions.
Reduces crop failure risk through timely weather, pest, and irrigation alerts.
Improves income stability by linking farmers to real-time market prices.
Promotes sustainable farming with optimized water, fertilizer, and pesticide use.
2.Benefits
Higher productivity & yield.
Lower input costs (fertilizer, water, pesticide).
Better market access & fair prices.
Inclusive access through multilingual, voice, and SMS support.
Alignment with government schemes & digital agriculture goals.
